# NiCE Cognigy Plugin

> Distributed exclusively as a **plugin** — supported by **Claude Code** and **Codex** today, with more clients to come. The plugin installs its server engine (pinned to the plugin version) and ships skills + agents.

A plugin that connects your AI assistant to the [Cognigy.AI](https://www.cognigy.com) REST API. Create, test, and improve LLM-based AI Agents through a self-improvement loop — without leaving your client.

**Quick links:** [Installation](#installation) · [Staying up to date](#staying-up-to-date)

## Features

- **17 workflow tools** for agent creation, deployment, packaging, voice setup, and live schema introspection
- **One-call agent setup**: creates Agent + Flow + AI Agent Job Node + REST Endpoint automatically
- **Self-improvement loop**: talk to your agent, evaluate responses, update the job description, repeat
- **Knowledge store support**: attach RAG knowledge stores to agents as tools
- **Browser voice deployment**: create Voice Gateway endpoints with WebRTC demo URLs
- **Voice preview setup**: configure supported speech providers for voice experiences
- **Skills + agents**: workflow guidance auto-loads as skills in supporting clients; build/go-live loops run as subagents
- **Built-in docs lookup**: bundles the official [Cognigy documentation](https://docs.cognigy.com) MCP server — your assistant searches and reads the docs before answering platform questions, instead of guessing from training data
- Built-in rate limiting, Zod input validation, and RFC 7807 error responses

Detailed workflow guidance (agent creation, knowledge/RAG, voice, webchat, flow nodes, packages, settings, LLM providers, tools, troubleshooting) ships as **skills** that load automatically when your request matches, in clients that support them (e.g. Claude Code) — see below.

## Installation

### Step 1 — Run the installer

**macOS / Linux** — one line (checks for Node.js, then runs the installer):

```
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cognigy/cognigy-plugin/main/install.sh)
```

**Windows (PowerShell)** — open as **Administrator**, then:

```
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cognigy/cognigy-plugin/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

> The bootstrap only checks that Node.js 20+ is present (it tells you how to install it if not — it never installs it for you), then hands off to the real installer.

Already have [Node.js 20+](https://nodejs.org)? You can skip the bootstrap and run the installer directly:

```
npx -y -p @cognigy/plugin-engine@latest cognigy-setup
```

Pick your client(s), enter your Cognigy API base URL (press Enter for the trial default) and API key (masked as you type), then restart the client.

✅ **Claude Code users — you're done.** You get the tools, skills, and agents. (The standalone CLI and the Claude Desktop **"Code"** tab share the same install.)

> 🔄 **Turn on auto-updates** so future fixes reach you automatically — Claude Code leaves this **off** for third-party marketplaces by default. One-time step: see [Staying up to date](#staying-up-to-date).

> **Only have Claude Desktop, no `claude` CLI?** The installer wires the chat connector (tools) and prints how to add the plugin in the Desktop **Code** tab's plugin browser (`+` → Plugins → Add plugin → `Cognigy/cognigy-plugin`) for skills + agents.

> **On Windows, after installing for Claude Code:** a normal restart may not be enough to load the plugin. **Fully quit** Claude Code — end every **Claude** process in **Task Manager** (a normal close can leave it running in the background), then reopen it. If the tools, skills, and agents still don't appear, **restart your machine**.

> **On Windows, after installing for Claude Desktop:** to make the connector appear:
>
> 1. **Fully restart** Claude Desktop — closing the window leaves it running in the system tray; quit it from there (or via Task Manager) so it actually relaunches.
> 2. Check that the **Cognigy** connector now shows up under Settings → Connectors.
> 3. If it does, **disable it and re-enable it once** — this forces a tool refresh so the Cognigy tools load.

### Step 2 — Claude Desktop chat only: finish in the app

Step 1 already wired the working connector, so **the tools work now**. To also get the **skills and agents**, install the plugin from inside Claude Desktop:

1. Click **Customize** in the left sidebar.
2. Next to **Personal plugins**, click **+**, hover **Add**, and click **Add marketplace**.
3. In the URL field enter `Cognigy/cognigy-plugin`, select the found result, and click **Sync**.
4. The `cognigy-plugin` marketplace is now added.
5. Install the **Cognigy** plugin by clicking **+**.
6. On the warning about a local MCP, click **Continue**.

Leave the plugin's own `platform` connector **unconnected** — the `Cognigy` connector from Step 1 already serves the tools.

<details>
<summary>Why the extra step on Claude Desktop? (for the technically curious)</summary>

The plugin ships its own connector (`platform`), but on **Claude Desktop chat** it can't be given credentials — Desktop stores plugin config in your claude.ai account rather than a local file, and offers no field to enter the API key, so that connector stays a no-op. To make the tools work regardless, the Step 1 installer wires a **standalone `Cognigy` connector** directly into `claude_desktop_config.json` (credentials stored there, `chmod 600`) behind an auto-updating, offline-safe launcher. The plugin install in Step 2 then adds only the parts Desktop _can_ deliver — the skills and agents. Claude Code has none of these limitations, which is why it's a single step.

</details>

> 🔄 **Claude Desktop users:** the connector keeps its engine current on every restart, but see [Staying up to date](#staying-up-to-date) for how updates work and how to check versions.

<details>
<summary>Scripting / CI, and manual install</summary>

**Scripting / CI** — skip the prompts with flags:

```
npx -y -p @cognigy/plugin-engine@latest cognigy-setup \
  --client claude-code --client claude-desktop \
  --api-base-url https://api-trial.cognigy.ai --api-key <key>
```

**Manual install (Claude Code)** — instead of the installer:

```
/plugin marketplace add Cognigy/cognigy-plugin
/plugin install cognigy@cognigy-plugin
```

then `npx -y -p @cognigy/plugin-engine@latest cognigy-setup --client claude-code` to wire credentials.

</details>

## Staying up to date

Claude Desktop auto-updates the engine on every launch. Claude Code updates only when marketplace auto-update is enabled (third-party marketplaces default **off**): turn it on under `/plugin → Marketplaces → cognigy-plugin`, or run `/plugin update cognigy@cognigy-plugin`. The first Claude Code session downloads the engine — if tools don't appear, run `/mcp` and reconnect (or restart); later sessions are instant.

The installer also doubles as a manager (run the same `cognigy-setup` with a subcommand):

```
npx -y -p @cognigy/plugin-engine@latest cognigy-setup status      # what's installed + latest available
npx -y -p @cognigy/plugin-engine@latest cognigy-setup update      # pull the latest (Claude Code)
npx -y -p @cognigy/plugin-engine@latest cognigy-setup uninstall   # remove plugin + connector (--purge also clears ~/.cognigy-plugin)
```

Beyond the MCP tools, the plugin ships **skills** and **agents** that surface the workflows automatically:

- **Skills** (`/skills`) — one per workflow (agent creation, knowledge/RAG, voice gateway, voice go-live checklist, webchat, flow nodes, packages, settings, LLM providers, tools, troubleshooting). Claude loads the matching skill automatically when your request fits.
- **Agents** (`/agents`) — `cognigy-agent-builder` runs the full build-and-test loop for a new agent, and `cognigy-voice-go-live` audits a voice agent against the Go-Live Checklist and applies the safe fixes. Each runs in its own context and reports back a summary.

## What It Does

Create a complete AI Agent in one tool call, then iterate and improve through conversation:

1. **Create** → AI Agent + Flow + Job Node + Endpoint (automatic)
2. **Test** → Talk to your agent via REST endpoint
3. **Improve** → Update persona, guardrails, job description, tools
4. **Test Again** → Compare responses and iterate
5. **Deploy** → Publish to Webchat or create a Voice Gateway endpoint with one call

## Configuration

The [installer](#installation) collects your **Cognigy API base URL** and **API key** and wires them per client: on Claude Code into the system **keychain**, on Claude Desktop into `claude_desktop_config.json` (`chmod 600`). The engine receives them as environment variables. If neither is set for a given launch, the engine falls back to `~/.cognigy-plugin/config.json` (`chmod 600`), which the installer also writes — so credentials resolve from the environment first, then that file. The optional variables below can be set in the MCP server `env` if you need to override defaults.

| Variable                  | Required | Default | Description                      |
| ------------------------- | -------- | ------- | -------------------------------- |
| `COGNIGY_API_BASE_URL`    | Yes      | —       | Your Cognigy API base URL        |
| `COGNIGY_API_KEY`         | Yes      | —       | Your Cognigy API key             |
| `LOG_LEVEL`               | No       | `info`  | `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` |
| `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS` | No       | `100`   | Max requests per window          |
| `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS`    | No       | `60000` | Rate limit window in ms          |

## Usage Examples

### 1. Create a customer support agent

```
Create a Cognigy AI Agent called "Support Bot" in project <projectId> with a helpful
customer support persona. If the project has no working LLM, first look for another
project with an llm_model that has a connectionId, import that LLM and its connection
via manage_packages, and only fall back to setup_llm if no reusable LLM exists.
Return the endpoint URL only after the project has a confirmed working LLM.
```

The MCP server should first check whether the target project already has a working LLM. If not, it should prefer reusing the required LLM resource set plus its connection resources from another project via `manage_packages`, and only use `setup_llm` as the last resort before calling `create_ai_agent`.

### 2. Test and improve the agent

```
Talk to my Support Bot at <endpointUrl> and ask "How do I reset my password?".
Then update the job description to make the response more concise and actionable.
Talk to it again and compare the responses.
```

This triggers the self-improvement loop: `talk_to_agent` → evaluate → `update_ai_agent` → `talk_to_agent` again.

### 3. Add a knowledge store for RAG

```
Create a knowledge store in project <projectId>, add the URL
https://docs.example.com/faq as a source, then attach it to my Support Bot
so the agent can search it when answering questions.
```

The server will call `manage_knowledge` to create the store and ingest the URL,
then `create_tool` to attach it as a knowledge search tool on the agent's job
node.

If the project will use Knowledge Search, the server should first configure
Knowledge AI Settings with `manage_settings { operation: 'set_knowledge_ai',
... }` using model IDs from the same project.

For normal AI-agent knowledge flows, this should happen before
`manage_knowledge { operation: 'create_store', ... }`.

The model roles are different:

- The knowledge store itself needs an embedding-capable model for the index.
- `knowledgeSearchModelId` is a separate Knowledge AI setting for search
  behavior, but the accepted model type is instance-dependent.
- If reusing another project's knowledge setup, identify the exact source-project
  Knowledge Search model first and import it into the target project before the
  first `set_knowledge_ai` attempt.
- Import the full required knowledge model set in one pass. If the embedding
  model, Knowledge Search model, and agent model share one connection, transfer
  that single connection once alongside all of those models.
- After importing LLMs into the target project, enumerate the target
  project's `llm_model` resources and try those same-project IDs before
  creating a new model.
- For Knowledge Search specifically, use `list_resources` with
  `resourceType: 'llm_model'` and `useCase: 'knowledgeSearch'` so the
  candidates match the Settings UI dropdown rather than the unfiltered
  project-wide LLM list.
- Do not substitute a fresh or generic model for `knowledgeSearchModelId`
  unless the user explicitly asks for that and existing same-project candidates
  have already failed API validation.
- If the exact source-project Knowledge Search model is missing from the target
  project, import it before trying a different model.
- If all same-project candidates fail, report the exact attempted model IDs
  and API errors rather than claiming a platform-side bug.
- Do not describe an untried model as "likely" unsupported or rejected.
- Treat model names in examples as examples only, not as the source of truth.

### 4. Get analytics on recent conversations

```
Show me the last 20 conversations for project <projectId> and summarize
what topics users asked about most.
```

Uses `list_resources` to fetch conversations, then your AI assistant summarizes the content.

### 5. List all projects and agents

```
List all my Cognigy projects and show which AI Agents exist in each one.
```

Uses `list_resources` with `resourceType: 'project'` and `resourceType: 'agent'`.

### 6. Import a package into a project

```
Upload the package at /absolute/path/to/support-bot.zip into project <projectId>,
show me the import preview, then import it using the default selections.
```

Uses `manage_packages` with `operation: 'upload_and_inspect'`, then `operation: 'import'`.

### 7. Export a package from project resources

```
Create a package named "support-bot" from these resource IDs in project <projectId>,
include dependencies, and save the zip to /absolute/path/to/exports/.
```

Uses `manage_packages` with `operation: 'list_exportable'` to discover candidates, then `operation: 'export'`, then `operation: 'download'` when needed.

### 8. Configure voice preview and create a browser voice endpoint

```
Set the voice preview provider for project <projectId> to Microsoft, then create
a Voice Gateway endpoint for flow <flowId> named "Support Voice" and give me the
WebRTC demo URL I can open in the browser.
```

This uses `manage_settings` with `operation: 'set_voice_preview'` to configure speech, then `manage_voice_gateway` to provision a `voiceGateway2` endpoint with a `webrtcDemoUrl`.

### 9. Configure Knowledge AI settings for search

```
Configure Knowledge AI settings for project <projectId> by setting the Knowledge Search
model and the Content Parser. If I am creating a new project and another project already
has a working knowledge setup, reproduce that exact Knowledge Search model and Content
Parser choice in the new project before trying generic defaults.
```

This uses `manage_settings` with `operation: 'set_knowledge_ai'` to configure
`knowledgeSearch` and `contentParser` at the project-settings level. Reusing
settings does not mean copying another project's settings alone; the required
model must exist in the target project first, either by import or by creating it there.
For knowledge workflows, the MCP should import the full required source-project model set
in one pass, reuse shared connections only once, and try the imported same-project model
IDs before falling back to `setup_llm`.

## Security

- API keys are passed via environment variables and never logged
- All inputs are validated using Zod schemas before reaching the API
- Rate limiting is built in to prevent API abuse

## Privacy Policy

This MCP server transmits requests to the Cognigy.AI API endpoint configured via `COGNIGY_API_BASE_URL`. No data is collected, stored, or shared by this MCP server itself — all data remains between your AI client and your Cognigy.AI instance.
