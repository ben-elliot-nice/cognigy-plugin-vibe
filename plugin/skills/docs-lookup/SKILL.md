# Cognigy Docs Lookup

The plugin bundles the official Cognigy documentation MCP server (docs.cognigy.com). Use it as the source of truth for platform questions — the platform changes faster than model training data. Prefer documented answers over prior knowledge, and link the doc page you used.

**Default to the filesystem tool, not search.** Cognigy's docs pages are very large (`parameter-details.mdx` alone is 62 KB) and `search_cognigy_documentation` returns matched pages _whole_ rather than as excerpts, so its payload scales with page size instead of relevance. Measured: a Voice Gateway barge-in query returned 90 KB via search vs ~4 KB via `rg`; a conceptual "which tool does the AI Agent call" query returned 280 KB via search — exceeding the tool-result limit and yielding nothing usable — vs ~3 KB via `rg`.

## Tools

- `query_docs_filesystem_cognigy_documentation` — **the primary tool.** Read-only shell-like queries over a virtual filesystem of every docs page (`.mdx`) plus OpenAPI specs. The server documents support for `rg`, `grep`, `find`, `tree`, `ls`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `stat`, `wc`, `sort`, `uniq`, `cut`, `sed`, `awk`, `jq` and basic text utilities; run `--help` on any command to confirm usage. Flag coverage is narrower than GNU (e.g. `cat -A` is rejected), so keep flags conventional. These run inside the MCP tool's virtual filesystem — NEVER in the local shell. Each call is stateless: the working directory resets to `/`, so use absolute paths or chain with `&&` (`cd /api-reference && ls`).
- `search_cognigy_documentation` — semantic search. Takes only a `query` string: no result limit, no relevance floor, no filters. Fall back to it only when you cannot guess the docs' vocabulary at all. Expect a very large result; when it overflows into a file, triage by extracting the `Title:`/`Page:` lines, then read the best one or two pages with the filesystem tool — never read the dump whole.
- `submit_feedback` — report incorrect, outdated, or confusing docs to the Cognigy docs team. Offer this when you and the user hit a genuine documentation gap.

## Workflow

1. **Orient** (only when unsure where a topic lives): `tree / -L 2`. Top-level sections are `ai/`, `voice-gateway/`, `webchat/`, `api-reference/`, `api-reference-simulator/`, `insights/`, `live-agent/`, `agent-copilot/`, `ops-center/`, `xApps/`, `click-to-call/`, `release-notes/`, `openapi/`, `help/`.
2. **Locate — cast wide.** `rg -l -i "term1|term2|term3" /<section>/` lists candidate files. Use a _deliberately broad_ alternation of synonyms and phrasings: `rg` is lexical, so a too-narrow pattern either returns nothing or — worse — returns only tangential pages while missing the right one, with nothing to signal the miss (see the worked example below). Match the docs' own title-case UI labels ("Tool Choice", "Barge In", "Set Session Config"), not the user's phrasing.
3. **Extract — narrow.** `rg -n -i -A3 "<best term>" /<path>.mdx` pulls the exact rows with context. Prefer this over `cat` on a large page; use `head -200 /<path>.mdx` when you need the page's structure, and `wc -c /<path>.mdx` first if you're unsure of its size.
4. **Answer** from what the docs say and cite the page link. **Strip the `.mdx` suffix to build the public URL** — the filesystem path is internal and the `.mdx` form 404s. Filesystem paths already start with `/`, so do not add another slash:

   ```
   /ai/agents/develop/node-reference/ai/ai-agent.mdx        ← filesystem path
   https://docs.cognigy.com/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/ai/ai-agent   ← cite this
   ```

   If docs and observed API behavior conflict, say so explicitly — the plugin's own skills (flow-nodes, troubleshooting) capture hard-won API gotchas the public docs may not cover.

> **Anchors don't work in directory mode.** `^` and `$` match when the target is an explicit file path, but silently match NOTHING when the target is a directory (cause unknown — some quirk of how the virtual filesystem serves directory traversal). Verified: `rg -c '^REST Endpoint' /api-reference/flows/create-a-flow.mdx` → 1, but `rg -l '^REST Endpoint' /api-reference/flows/` → 0 files, while the same pattern unanchored → 13 files. So: **search directories unanchored, and only anchor once you are pointing at a single file.**

### Worked example — "how does the AI Agent Node decide which tool to call?"

```
rg -l -i "tool.?selection|which tool|selects a tool|tool choice" /ai/
  → /ai/agents/develop/node-reference/ai/ai-agent.mdx  (+3 others)

rg -n -i -A3 "tool choice" /ai/agents/develop/node-reference/ai/ai-agent.mdx
  → the Tool Choice parameter table (Auto / Required / None) and the
    "Avoiding Infinite Loops when Tool Choice is Required" section
```

Two calls, ~3 KB, complete answer.

Note the wide alternation in step 1 — and note how it fails when narrowed. `rg -l -i "tool.?selection|which tool" /ai/` does **not** come back empty; it returns exactly one file, `/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/service/add-transcript-step.mdx`, and silently misses `ai-agent.mdx`, the page that actually documents the setting. **A plausible wrong page is more dangerous than no result**, because nothing signals that you should keep looking. The docs call the setting **Tool Choice**; matching their label is what separates the two outcomes.

## REST API routes — use `find`, not `rg`

`/api-reference/` is organised as `<resource>/<verb-phrase>.mdx` (e.g. `/api-reference/flows/create-a-flow.mdx`), and every page carries its route on one line as `REST Endpoint <METHOD> <path>`. Because the filenames are predictable English, **`find` by filename beats keyword guessing** — this sidesteps the vocabulary problem entirely.

```
# intent → page (expect near-miss siblings; pick by name)
find /api-reference -iname "*create-a-flow*"
  → /api-reference/flows/create-a-flow.mdx
  → /api-reference/flows/create-a-flow-from-a-child-node.mdx

# whole API surface for one resource, ~13 compact lines
rg -N --no-filename "REST Endpoint" /api-reference/flows/ | sort -u
  → GET|PATCH|POST /v2.0/flows, DELETE|GET|PATCH /v2.0/flows/{flowId},
    GET /v2.0/flows/{flowId}/chart, POST /v2.0/flows/{flowId}/clone, …

# route → page (reverse lookup; unanchored, so sub-routes also match)
rg -l "REST Endpoint POST /v2\.0/flows" /api-reference/flows/
```

**Never `cat` an API-reference page.** Half to nine-tenths of each one is the identical `400/401/402/403/404/405/409/413/5xx` error-envelope boilerplate, and the response schema usually repeats the request schema. Cut to the useful part:

```
sed -n '/^REST Endpoint/,/^Responses:/p' /api-reference/flows/create-a-flow.mdx
```

That yields route + summary + query/header params + request body in **946 bytes vs 6,627 for the full page**. Measured across three sampled endpoint pages the reduction ranged **3.4×–7.4×** (`create-an-ai-agent` 9,800→2,919; `create-a-flow` 6,627→946; `create-a-knowledge-store` 5,867→796). Add `/^Responses:/,/^400:/p` as a second range when you need the success-response shape.

## When NOT to use

- Plugin/tool mechanics (which MCP tool to call, tool arguments) — that is this plugin's own skills, not the public docs.
- Live project state (what agents/flows exist) — use `list_resources` / `get_resource`.
