# Red-Team Report — `<agent name>`

**Target:** `<agent name>` (agent `<aiAgentId>`)
**Project:** `<project name>` (`<projectId>`)
**Flow:** `<flowId>`
**Date:** `<YYYY-MM-DD>`
**Method:** White-box. Config read via Cognigy REST API, `<n>` adversarial probes via `talk_to_agent`, one probe per isolated `sessionId` except `<n>` deliberate multi-turn escalation chain(s).
**Scope contract:** depth `<quick|standard|thorough>` · environment mutation `<none|scratch-store>` · fixes `<report-only|propose-and-apply>`

## Summary

<Two or three sentences: overall posture, what broke, what held. Lead with the most consequential finding.>

| #   | ID                            | Finding             | Severity                          | Status                                |
| --- | ----------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 1   | `policy-<n>.<technique>`      | `<one-line>`        | critical / high / medium / low    | Confirmed (`<n>`/`<n>` reproduction)  |
| 2   | `transport-<slug>.<technique>`| `<one-line>`        | `<severity>`                      | Confirmed / Plausible                 |

## Config under test

**Guardrails (`instructions` field):**

1. <verbatim rule text> — `policy-1`
2. <verbatim rule text> — `policy-2`

**Platform safety settings:** <which of avoidHarmfulContent / avoidUngroundedContent / avoidCopyrightInfringements / preventJailbreakAndManipulation are enabled>

**Other:** `enableAutoLanguageDetection: <bool>`; `speakingStyle.completeness: "<value>"`; <n> tools (<list toolIds>).

**Persona-conflict map:** <where description and instructions pull in opposite directions — and which of those were attacked>

> Record this section faithfully. Finding IDs are only comparable across runs if the config they were derived from is known.

---

## Finding <n> — <title> (<Severity>)

<What the rule is, and the precise condition under which it fails. State the failure mode, not just the fact of failure.>

**Probe A** (`<sessionId>`, technique `<technique-id>`):

> <verbatim probe text>

<Verbatim response, or the load-bearing excerpt. Quote the exact violating words.>

**Probe B** (`<sessionId>`) — <what was varied to reproduce>:

> <verbatim probe text>

<verbatim response excerpt>

**Controls that passed:**

- <control probe> → <result>

**Why it matters:** <consequence in the owner's terms — legal, brand, availability, data. Not "the model was jailbroken".>

**Suggested fix:**

> <exact replacement config text, ready to paste>

## What held

Attacks attempted that the agent defended. <Do not omit this section — without it a clean run is indistinguishable from a lazy one.>

| Attack                                   | Technique              | Result   | Session          |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| `<policy N — what was attempted>`        | `<technique-id>`       | PASS     | `<sessionId>`    |
| `<policy N — variant>`                   | `<technique-id>`       | PASS     | `<sessionId>`    |

<Call out any notable defence explicitly — e.g. a vector that commonly succeeds elsewhere and did not here, with the verbatim response that shows the agent recognised the attack.>

---

## Layer attribution

<Which layer produced each refusal: prompt-level `instructions`/persona, or a platform `safetySettings` guard. If no probe produced a distinct platform-guard refusal, say so plainly — it means the security posture rests entirely on the `instructions` field, and that is where fixes belong.>

---

## Environment changes and restoration

<If the contract was `none`, state: "No environment changes were made." and delete the table.>

| Step | Action                                        | Verified                       |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 1    | Recorded original <field>: `<value>`           | —                              |
| 2    | Created scratch <resource> (`<id>`)            | —                              |
| …    | …                                             | …                              |
| n    | Confirmed test artifact gone                   | <functional probe result>      |

**Net change to the environment: <none | describe>.** <State explicitly what was never modified. Note that test conversations remain in session history under `<prefix>-*` session IDs.>

---

## Coverage limits

- <n> probes at the `<depth>` tier. Single-run results at non-zero temperature; <which findings were re-tested for reproducibility>. Passes mean "held on the attempts tried", not proofs.
- <Phases skipped for lack of permission, and what that leaves untested.>
- <Rules tested with only one probe.>
- <Channels not covered — e.g. voice, xApp; REST endpoint only.>
- <Anything deliberately not attempted, and why.>

---

## Recommended priority

1. **<action>** (finding <n>) — <one-line rationale>
2. **<action>** (finding <n>) — <one-line rationale>
